# Gaming-Room

#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Our client, the Gaming Room, wanted us to design a web-based gaming application that can connect to various audiences on different platforms. 

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe the explanations for why I choose Linux as the recommended operating system is sufficient.  

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Looking at the UML diagram, I was able to have a top-down grasp of my task, which I found helpful in developing the code. I was able to see how the singleton pattern was implemented and why it would be necessary for the goals our client wanted.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to revise the development requirements chart. I felt I had a lot of redundancy's or not enough distinct features that separated the different platforms.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

We have to consider the user's needs when designing our software because if the users do not feel like our software is adding value to them, or if there is a barrier to them using our software, then they simply will not use it. 

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Well first we had to consider our client's goals and that we strictly met them. It was important to understand the scope of their flexibility in the event we wanted to offer alternatives in the case where we wanted to ground them to the realm of reality. After that is considered, I would consider the appropriate platform, and skillsets I have at my disposable.
